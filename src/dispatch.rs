//! Global FIFO slot dispatcher. Every client connection — one OpenCode, five
//! OpenCodes, an n8n flow, a Codex session — funnels through one queue, so
//! under contention slots are granted strictly in arrival order instead of
//! letting freshly-arrived requests win wakeup races against long waiters.
//!
//! The dispatcher is the only `Pool::reserve` caller in the app, and it holds
//! the [`PoolHandle`] read lock across each reserve — so a settings-driven
//! pool swap (which takes the write lock) can never interleave with a grant.
//! Grants carry the `Arc<Pool>` that made them (see [`Slot`]) so cooldown and
//! release always land on the granting pool; a late op on a retired pool is
//! benign because nothing consults it anymore.
