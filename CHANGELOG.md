# Changelog

All notable changes to nim-proxy are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New `POST /v1/messages` Anthropic-compatible bridge: requests are converted
  to the OpenAI chat dialect, paced through the shared key pool exactly like
  the `/v1` passthrough, and answered in the Anthropic dialect. Non-2xx
  upstream statuses are re-shape-mapped into the Anthropic error envelope with
  the same status code; existing `/v1/*` wire behavior is unchanged.
- The request-shape metric family gains an `endpoint` label (`chat`,
  `messages`): every pre-existing series changes shape (a new label
  dimension), and the new `nimproxy_tool_type_total` counter counts offered
  tool families plus `server_rejected` offers.
- The OpenAPI spec gains the `createAnthropicMessage` operation, a `client_key`
  security scheme, and the `messages` tag — additions only; the
  `anthropicSSEStream` operation arrives with the streaming translator.

### Fixed

- Installed locale definitions now jointly drive locale bootstrap, public and
  operator catalog bytes, and route acceptance. Catalog URLs accept valid
  canonicalizable spellings such as `en-us`; `en-XA` remains test-only.
- Embedded invariant pages are assembled once per process. Login and setup
  retain their catalog gate for JavaScript clients while exposing their native
  server forms when JavaScript is unavailable. Native setup redirects into the
  authenticated dashboard without minting a client secret it cannot display.
- Settings retains the validated-model confirmation after successfully adding a
  NIM API key. History diagnostics now report actual inferred counter resets.
- Dashboard polling now distinguishes a render failure from a lost proxy
  connection. Dynamic style application isolates rejected nodes, percentage
  style keys remain bounded, publisher/client identity maps reject inherited
  keys, and stacked-chart tooltips resolve catalog series ids like their
  legends.
- Streaming deadlines now finalize the bounded observer exactly once. Usage
  measured before expiry remains measured; missing or explicit-null fields are
  unavailable rather than invalid.
- The Models finish-reason table includes the emitted `function_call` category,
  so all six bounded finish-reason shares are represented.
- Dashboard history rollups now release the config-store mutex after taking
  their small configuration snapshot. Sampler append/fsync work runs on the
  Tokio blocking pool and is joined before the next sample or shutdown.
- Contributor and knowledge documentation now match the split presentation
  layer, current locale/plural guards, and trusted-proxy boundary. The guide
  checker validates local links across maintained repository documentation.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-08-01

> **Breaking upgrade:** v0.6.6 intentionally starts dashboard history over,
> renames one Prometheus series, and removes the pricing contract. Back up the
> data volume before upgrading.

### Upgrade notes

- Canonical history now lives at `DATA_DIR/history-v1.jsonl`. The proxy does
  not read, rename, truncate, migrate, or delete the experimental
  `DATA_DIR/history.jsonl`; historical charts begin with post-upgrade data.
  Keep the old file for rollback or remove it manually after it is no longer
  needed.
- Rename dashboards, alerts, and recording rules from
  `nimproxy_lane_benched_total` to
  `nimproxy_lane_cooldown_total`. Every other pre-existing `nimproxy_*`
  series keeps its name.
- Pricing settings and estimated-savings fields are removed:
  `POST /api/settings/pricing`, `server.pricing`,
  `price_in`/`price_out`, and the `pricing` config block no longer have
  product meaning. Existing config stores still load; an orphan `pricing`
  block is ignored.
- The config store remains schema v1. Locale fields are additive: the server
  default is `en-US`, while each user's optional preference defaults to no
  override. No config migration framework or version bump is introduced.
- v0.6.6 ships only the `en-US` production catalog. The `en-XA`
  pseudolocale is generated only for tests, and valid but uninstalled locale
  preferences are rejected.

### Added

- **A complete canonical English presentation source.** The 449-message
  `src/web/locales/en-US.json` catalog owns repository text across the
  dashboard, Settings, setup, login, dialogs, validation, empty/error states,
  and accessibility labels. Model ids, client names, publisher names, API
  errors, persisted enums, credentials, and metric values remain unlocalized
  data.
- **Localization foundation without runtime translation.** Public setup/login
  pages receive an exact public catalog projection; the full catalog remains
  operator-authenticated. A typed public `GET /api/locale-bootstrap`
  operation, server default, and per-user preference establish the forward
  contract while `Intl` owns numbers, dates, durations, sorting, and plural
  categories. Validators enforce id parity, source freshness, placeholders,
  markup boundaries, frozen protocol tokens, and retired vocabulary.
- **A generated OpenAPI 3.1 contract.** `openapi.json` describes 17
  operations: 15 `/api/*` operations and the two setup POST operations.
  Locale bootstrap and both setup operations explicitly waive the
  document-level authentication requirement; the other 14 `/api/*`
  operations require operator authentication. The upstream-owned `/v1`
  surface, browser pages/assets, login forms, health, and Prometheus exposition
  remain deliberately outside this spec.
- **Explicit presentation and HTTP trust boundaries.** Public setup/login
  assets contain no operator catalog or private data. Dashboard, Settings, and
  operator assets share the post-setup session gate, which runs before locale
  lookup. Every live method/path contract is checked across phase,
  authentication, role, ownership, content type, side effects, and OpenAPI
  membership.
- **A split, compile-time presentation layer.** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
  catalogs remain framework-free and build-free, are embedded in the Rust
  binary, and are served from same-origin routes. Browser startup fails closed
  until bootstrap, authenticated config where required, and the selected
  catalog have resolved.
- **Committed browser and layout gates.** Rust-owned response fixtures drive 72
  named interaction states across all pages and Settings surfaces. Semantic,
  keyboard/focus, hostile-catalog, pseudolocale, responsive, cleanup, and
  full-document visual checks now run against bytes served by the real binary.
- **Canonical `nimproxy-history/v1`.** Typed boot, full-sample, and compact
  checkpoint records preserve five-minute anchors, restart boundaries,
  contemporaneous capacity, exact totals, query-scoped completeness, and
  atomic time-based retention without rewriting a full unchanged registry
  snapshot every five minutes.
- **Evidence-backed NIM response observations.** Sanitized buffered and SSE
  fixtures pin optional usage, finish, tool-call, framing, and invalid-field
  behavior without retaining prompts or completions. The bounded
  `nimproxy_usage_observations_total{field,result}` counter distinguishes
  `measured`, `estimated`, `unavailable`, and `invalid` instead of
  presenting absence as zero.

### Changed

- Dashboard and setup terminology now uses standard proxy, load-balancer,
  authentication, and operations language. `Harness` becomes **Client**;
  dashboard `window` becomes **time range**; presentation `lane` becomes
  **key**; `Conversation stickiness` becomes **Session affinity**;
  `Model-pressure governor` becomes **Model limits**; and
  `Where time goes` becomes **Latency breakdown**. Machine identifiers,
  route names, DOM hooks, config keys, and all metrics except the deliberate
  cooldown rename remain unchanged.
- Control-plane success and error bodies are typed Rust values with stable
  machine-readable rejection codes. JSON media-type, size, syntax/data,
  query, method, and route failures now use the same fail-closed boundary as
  handlers. ASCII-sorted member order remains a tested wire contract.
- The operator console now uses native landmarks, headings, buttons, tables,
  labels, and a focus-managed one-time-secret dialog. Responsive Settings
  layouts preserve usable form controls and long machine values from 390px
  through desktop widths.
- Presentation text now flows through context-owning sinks: native DOM text
  and allowlisted text attributes receive catalog ids, while fixed-markup
  builders receive inert descriptors that resolve and escape only at the HTML
  boundary. Catalog text cannot enter URLs, styles, events, scripts, CSS, or
  raw SVG.
- External font and icon dependencies are gone. The embedded UI uses system
  fonts and local SVG/text primitives under a same-origin Content Security
  Policy, keeping the product a single rootless `FROM scratch` binary.
- History reads valid physical segments without sorting or repairing bytes,
  exposes partial/unavailable ranges honestly, and compacts only after
  preserving the owning boot and full-sample boundary needed for exact retained
  totals.

### Fixed

- Initial setup now shares the pre-authentication attempt budget with login
  and key validation, rejecting excess claims before scheduling the 600,000-
  iteration PBKDF2 password hash.
- User-management requests now reject non-admin and stale sessions before
  starting requested-password PBKDF2 work, while rechecking authorization
  before committing the change.
- Dashboard uptime and stacked-chart totals now come from the canonical
  catalog, and the i18n lint rejects short or lowercase text in visible sinks.
- A 2xx status is classified consistently across availability, charts, and
  error taxonomy instead of treating only literal HTTP 200 as success.
- Dashboard catalog values no longer double-escape, and setup/runtime catalog
  writes enforce the same text-attribute allowlist and structured-message
  boundary.
- Chart hover no longer collides with a local date binding and falsely marks a
  healthy proxy disconnected.
- Client disconnects release queued and streaming ownership promptly, including
  the in-flight slot held while an upstream stream is blocked.
- Optional NIM usage values are independently range- and relationship-checked.
  Invalid children no longer erase valid siblings, missing reasoning usage no
  longer implies measured zero, and observation never rewrites proxied response
  bytes.
- Empty, whitespace-only, or future-version canonical history refuses startup;
  recoverable supported-v1 damage is retained as evidence and cannot silently
  become a complete dashboard range.

### Removed

- The estimated-savings feature and its pricing API/config/dashboard fields.
- Runtime Google Fonts and third-party icon requests.
- Compatibility aliases or import paths for experimental history formats.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Persisted dashboard traffic now appears immediately after login and remains
  truthful across process/container restarts. Startup indexing normalizes
  explicit v2 process epochs and legacy v1 counter resets; chart point limits
  no longer change reported totals.
- The existing dashboard time controls now apply one selected window across
  Overview, Models, Clients, Reliability, and Capacity. The default follows
  the retained 30-day window, fixed/paused ranges stay fixed, and **All
  retained** reaches the earliest available sample.
- Historical Capacity views now use the configuration recorded with each
  sample instead of comparing past traffic with today's pool. Unavailable
  pre-history time is no longer treated as observed capacity.

### Security

- Moved release metadata and image digests from inline shell-template
  expansions into step-scoped environment variables, and added a seven-day
  observation window for routine Cargo, GitHub Actions, and Docker dependency
  updates. Dependabot security updates remain immediate.
- Replaced the third-party GitHub Release publishing action with the
  GitHub-hosted runner's preinstalled `gh` CLI, preserving generated notes,
  verification instructions, and signed asset uploads while reducing the
  workflow's external action surface.

### Changed

- Docker Compose's host-side publish address is now configurable with
  `PUBLISH_HOST` in `.env` while retaining `127.0.0.1` as the safe default.
- Replaced browser parsing of raw `/metrics`, `/api/history`, and
  `/dash/config.json` data with authenticated typed range/current dashboard
  contracts, revision-aware live tails, and server-side exact rollups.
- Default dashboard window, data retention, and availability target are
  separate Server settings rather than hardcoded display assumptions. Window
  and retention default to 30 days; retention `0` is unlimited and finite
  retention cannot be shorter than the default view.
- Current lane/load values use the live **Now** snapshot while selected-window
  values stay historical.
- History retention now trims the in-memory index immediately and compacts the
  JSONL file atomically in the background while preserving the boundary
  baseline and boot marker needed for exact retained totals. The old
  fixed-size estimate was removed after a real 7,316-sample history measured
  235,598,655 bytes; size remains workload-dependent.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Added the opt-in `X-Nim-Proxy-Deadline-Ms` request header: an absolute
  wall-clock deadline enforced across queueing, worker admission, retries, and
  generation. Buffered expiry returns `504 deadline_exceeded`; streaming
  expiry emits the same error inside the committed SSE response. Expiry drops
  upstream work and all request-owned permits, and is exposed as request status
  `deadline` plus `nimproxy_deadline_exceeded_total`.

### Security

- Bumped `crossbeam-epoch` to 0.9.20 in `Cargo.lock` to resolve
  [RUSTSEC-2026-0204](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0204)
  (invalid pointer dereference in the `fmt::Pointer` impl for `Atomic`/`Shared`).
  It reaches us transitively via `metrics-util` →
  `metrics-exporter-prometheus`. Lockfile-only change; no dependency versions
  in `Cargo.toml` changed. Clears the `cargo-deny` advisories failure that was
  red on `main` and every open Dependabot PR.

### Changed

- Refreshed runtime and supply-chain dependencies: Tokio 1.53.1, bytes 1.12.1,
  serde 1.0.229, serde_json 1.0.151, futures-util 0.3.33, tokio-stream 0.1.19,
  the pinned Rust builder image and toolchain action, pinned GitHub Actions,
  and `sigstore/cosign-installer` 4.1.2.
- Migrated downloadable-asset signing to Cosign v3 Sigstore bundles, pinned
  the Cosign CLI independently of its installer action, and added a real
  sign/verify contract smoke test to CI.
- Internal cleanup (no behavior change): dropped a redundant `async` on the
  streaming handler (all `.await`s live inside its spawned task, so the
  function itself never awaited — this avoids wrapping it in a needless
  future), removed two redundant `String` clones on the key-add paths, and
  reused the destination buffer via `clone_from` when re-owning keys during
  superuser claim. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt`,
  and the full test suite (lib + e2e) stay green.
- Rewrote the `Basic`-auth credential branch in `auth::identify` with the `?`
  operator (behavior identical). Rust stable rolled to 1.97 on 2026-07-14 and
  its improved `clippy::question_mark` lint flagged the old
  `else if let … else { return None }` shape, breaking the `-D warnings` CI
  job on code untouched by any open PR. Covered by the existing auth tests.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-07-05

Supply-chain and static-analysis release — no proxy behavior changes.

### Documentation

- Enriched the PR template into a standard, agent-legible form (Summary / Type
  of change / Related issues / What & why / How it was tested / Breaking
  changes, plus a checklist grouped by concern with each conditional section
  labeled by its trigger).
- Documentation-consistency pass across README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, the
  test-strategy and release runbooks, and the issue templates: recorded the
  full current CI gate set (coverage, MSRV, workflow lint, dependency review,
  CodeQL) and the applied `main`/`v*` rulesets, added the fuzzing test layer
  and signed-release-asset notes, and corrected a stale `cargo audit` reference
  (it is `cargo-deny`) and an old version placeholder.

### Testing

- **Coverage expansion** (91.4% → 96.1% lines): new unit tests for the auth
  primitives (base64/unhex/session-shape/cookie-Secure/throttle-rollover —
  `auth.rs` is now 100%), `config::validate` rejection branches, `parse_role`
  (superuser is never assignable), the SSE 1 MiB guard, and history load +
  daily-compaction; plus e2e tests for setup double-claim, orphan client-key
  adoption, throttled/failed key probes, client/nim-key/user validation and
  ownership legs, and the auth handler surface (HTTP Basic scrape creds, login
  redirects, logout). The CI coverage gate is raised from 80% to 90%.

### Added

- **Release assets are signed** (`cosign sign-blob`, keyless via OIDC): the
  downloadable per-arch tarballs and the SBOM now ship with a detached
  signature (`.sig`) and the signing certificate (`.pem`), so a binary pulled
  from the Releases page is verifiable with `cosign verify-blob` — previously
  only the container image was signed. The release notes carry the exact
  verification command.

- **Fuzz testing** (`fuzz/` + a weekly smoke-fuzz workflow): cargo-fuzz
  targets for the three untrusted-byte parsers — the upstream SSE scanner
  (arbitrary fragmentation, buffer-bound invariant), the Prometheus-label
  sanitizer (charset/length/non-empty invariants), and the config-store
  JSON round-trip (parse never panics; save→load is a fixpoint). The crate
  is now a thin binary over a library so the fuzz harnesses can link the
  internals; no public API is added (`#[doc(hidden)]` wrappers only).

- **Repo hygiene & metadata**: `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes` (LF
  normalization + language-stats fix so the repo reads as Rust, not HTML),
  `rust-toolchain.toml` (stable + rustfmt/clippy for contributors),
  `SUPPORT.md`, and a release-notes template (`.github/release.yml`) that
  groups generated notes by PR label. Cargo.toml now declares
  `rust-version = "1.87"` (measured with `cargo msrv find`) plus
  keywords/categories/homepage, and a new CI `msrv` job builds with exactly
  that toolchain. The Docker build base is digest-pinned. README gains the
  OpenSSF Best Practices badge and a contributing/security/support section.

- **CodeQL static analysis** for the Rust source on every PR, push to main,
  and a weekly re-scan (`build-mode: none` — no cargo build needed).
- **Workflow lint job in CI**: `actionlint` (correctness, always gates) and
  `zizmor` (Actions security lint; every severity is uploaded to code
  scanning, high-severity findings fail the build).
- **Dependency review on PRs**: introducing a crate with a known
  vulnerability now fails the PR (licenses stay `cargo-deny`'s job).
- **Weekly advisories audit** (`audit.yml`): the lockfile is checked against
  the RUSTSEC database on a schedule, so a new advisory surfaces within a
  week instead of at the next push.

### Changed

- Upgraded the CodeQL Action from v3 to v4 (both `codeql.yml` and the
  Scorecard SARIF upload), clearing the Node 20 deprecation and the
  December-2026 v3 sunset warnings.

- **CodeQL scope**: a config file (`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`) now
  excludes the `tests/**` and `fuzz/**` trees, so the hard-coded-secret
  queries fire on the operator-facing source but not on intentional test
  fixtures (throwaway passwords, RFC-vector salts). The handful of fixture
  alerts inside `#[cfg(test)]` modules in scanned source are dismissed as
  "used in tests".

- The release workflow now runs under a global concurrency group (one release
  at a time, queued rather than cancelled), and the `prepare` script takes
  workflow-context values via `env` instead of inline template expansion.

- **Workflow hardening to the OpenSSF-recommended baseline**: every GitHub
  Actions step is pinned to a full commit SHA (Dependabot keeps the pins
  fresh); all CI/release jobs start with `step-security/harden-runner` egress
  monitoring (audit mode); checkouts that don't push drop their credentials
  (`persist-credentials: false`); and a weekly OpenSSF Scorecard workflow
  publishes the repo's supply-chain score to code scanning and the README
  badge.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-04

CI/release infrastructure release — no proxy behavior changes.

### Changed

- **Release images build on native runners in parallel**: amd64 on
  `ubuntu-latest` and arm64 on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, each pushed by digest and
  stitched into one multi-arch manifest; the cosign signature, provenance
  attestation, and SBOM now target the manifest digest. This removes the
  QEMU-emulated arm64 Rust compile that made releases take ~30 minutes.
  Buildx layer caching added to the release and CI image builds.
- CI runs superseded by a newer push to the same ref are cancelled
  (concurrency groups; main is never cancelled), and the CI image smoke test
  no longer sets legacy env vars retired in 0.6.0.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-04

Maintenance release — no proxy behavior changes; it exists to ship and
validate the new release automation.

### Changed

- **Releases can be cut from the Actions UI** (`workflow_dispatch` on the
  Release workflow): a new `prepare` job resolves the version from Cargo.toml
  on the default branch, refuses if that tag already exists, mints and pushes
  the `v*` tag itself, and the same run carries the release end-to-end — no
  local `git tag`/`git push` needed. The tag-push path still works and keeps
  its tag-must-match-Cargo.toml guard; image tags and the GitHub Release tag
  now come from the resolved version rather than the triggering git ref.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-04

> **Breaking (v0.6.0):** app-level configuration moved from env vars into a
> UI-managed store. `NIM_API_KEYS`, `PROXY_API_KEYS`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`,
> `INSECURE_NO_AUTH`, `NIM_BASE_URL`, `RPM_PER_KEY`, `MAX_WAIT_SECS`,
> `HEARTBEAT_SECS`, `MODELS_TTL_SECS`, `STREAM_IDLE_SECS`,
> `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `STRICT_PASSTHROUGH`, `REF_PRICE_IN`/`REF_PRICE_OUT`,
> `HISTORY_DAYS`, and `MAX_INFLIGHT` are **ignored** (a one-line boot warning
> lists any still set). Configure everything in the dashboard on first run. The
> dashboard is now multi-user (username + password), and `INSECURE_NO_AUTH` is
> replaced by an `open|keyed` API-access mode that affects only `/v1`. There is
> no migration (there were no deployments to migrate).

### Added

- **UI-managed config store + first-run setup wizard**: app-level config lives
  in `DATA_DIR/config.json` (version 1, atomic writes, 0600), edited from a new
  dashboard **Settings** area (sub-nav: Access & keys · Server · Users ·
  Account) and claimed by a 3-step wizard (create superuser → add ≥1 NIM key,
  validated live against the upstream → finish, logged in). A corrupt/unreadable
  or future-version store is a hard boot error, never a silent fall-through to
  setup. JSON not SQLite — see
  `knowledge/decisions/ui-managed-config-store.md`.
- **Multi-user with roles & per-key ownership**: `superuser` (an admin that can
  never be deleted), `admin` (server settings + user management), `user` (own
  account, own client keys, own NIM keys). Dashboards are identical for every
  role; `GET /api/config` is filtered server-side so hidden sections are absent
  from the payload, not CSS-hidden. Sessions carry the username plus a fragment
  of the password hash, so a password change/reset invalidates that user's
  sessions instantly and role changes/deletion apply on the next request.
  Passwords are PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600k iterations, RFC 7914 vectors). See the
  v0.6.0 amendment in
  `knowledge/decisions/auth-posture-and-dashboard-password.md`.
- **Per-key rpm and live key management**: each NIM key has its own rpm
  (default 40, range 1–10000), an owner, and an enable/disable toggle; the pool
  rebuilds live on any change with rate-state carryover (kept keys keep their
  in-window counts; disabled keys re-enable warm). The superuser always owns ≥1
  enabled key (the pool floor). Client API keys are server-generated 128-bit
  secrets with an `npk_` prefix, shown exactly once and stored only as SHA-256
  digests (+ last-4 for display).
- **Model-pressure governor**: classifies NIM's per-model worker-concurrency
  exhaustion (`Worker local total request limit reached`) apart from plain 429s
  and backs off the **model** (never benches the lane, since key failover can't
  help). Adaptive and zero-config (engages at half observed in-flight, +1 per
  stable minute, dissolves after 30 clean minutes) with optional per-model
  pinned caps in Settings. New metrics `nimproxy_worker_exhausted_total{model}`,
  `nimproxy_model_inflight{model}`, `nimproxy_model_limit{model}` (0 =
  ungoverned), and a Reliability **Model pressure** card that appears only once
  the governor has engaged. See `knowledge/architecture/governor.md`;
  `mock_nim.py` gained `--worker-slots N` and `loadtest.py` reports worker
  exhaustions + peak per-model concurrency.
- **Redesigned dashboard**: a dark, NVIDIA-green "operator console" — left
  sidebar nav (collapses to an icon rail below 860px), top bar with range
  pills, Space Grotesk + Spline Sans Mono webfonts. Five persona-aligned tabs
  (`Overview · Models · Clients · Reliability · Capacity`), richer KPI cards
  with trend delta chips and sparklines, ring gauges, and a Reliability hero
  (availability vs a 99.9% SLO, a "where time goes" latency breakdown) and a
  Capacity hero (saturation bar, keys-for-peak provisioning chip). Every line
  chart now has a hover crosshair with a per-series tooltip, and every table
  is click-to-sort with a sticky header and internal scroll — sort order and
  scroll position both survive the 3s live refresh. See
  `knowledge/decisions/dashboard-operator-console-redesign.md`.
- **The wizard mints your first client key**: setup ends on a connect panel
  with the client base URL and a once-only `npk_` secret, so a fresh
  keyed-mode proxy serves `/v1` with no Settings detour. On by default;
  opting out shows an explicit warning (keyed with zero keys rejects every
  `/v1` call until a key exists).
- **New dashboard charts** for signals that were collected but never drawn:
  requests-by-outcome over time (Reliability), requested output budget per
  harness from `nimproxy_request_max_tokens` (Clients), and tool-call volume
  per model from `nimproxy_tool_calls_total` (Models).

### Fixed

- **Streaming requests now count against `max_inflight` for their whole
  lifetime.** The in-flight guard previously dropped when the response headers
  were returned, so the cap only bounded buffered requests — a flood of live
  streams could exceed it unbounded.
- **A client disconnect during a blocked upstream read is noticed
  immediately.** The streaming relay now races each upstream read against the
  client channel closing, so a hang-up frees the request's `max_inflight`
  slot at disconnect time instead of at the `stream_idle` cutoff — and a hung
  upstream can no longer pin a slot until restart when `stream_idle` is 0.
- **Own-password change guards against a concurrent admin reset.** The change
  commits only if the stored hash is still the one the current password was
  verified against; a reset landing in the verify window now wins with a 409
  instead of being silently overwritten by the stale change.

### Changed

- **Env shrinks to 5 container-level vars** (`HOST`, `PORT`, `DATA_DIR`,
  `RUST_LOG`, `TRUST_PROXY`); `DATA_DIR` must be writable (it now holds the
  credential store as well as history) and an unwritable dir is a hard boot
  error. `.env.example`, README, and the runbooks are rewritten to match; the
  quickstart is now `docker compose up` → open the dashboard → complete the
  wizard.
- **Dashboard auth is now user-based.** Login takes a username and password;
  the single `ADMIN_PASSWORD` gate is gone. Prometheus scrapers authenticate as
  `Authorization: Bearer <username>:<password>` (or HTTP Basic). Volume backups
  now contain credentials (`config.json`, 0600) — treat them as secrets.
- `docker compose up` now runs the published `ghcr.io/miztertea/nim-proxy:latest`
  image instead of building from source; source builds move to an explicit dev
  override (`docker-compose.dev.yml`, tagged `nim-proxy:dev`). README,
  CONTRIBUTING, and the deploy runbook updated to match.
- **CSP** now allows the dashboard's webfonts: `style-src` gained
  `https://fonts.googleapis.com`, and a new `font-src` allows
  `https://fonts.gstatic.com`. Falls back to system fonts if the CDN is
  unreachable.

### Removed

- **All app-level env vars** (see the breaking note above) — they're ignored,
  with a one-line boot warning listing any still set. No seed-from-env, no
  migration.
- **`INSECURE_NO_AUTH`.** Replaced by the store's `open|keyed` API-access mode,
  which governs only `/v1`; every dashboard/observability surface always
  requires a logged-in session post-setup.
- **Light mode.** The dashboard is dark-only now; the light palette and
  `prefers-color-scheme` handling were deleted as a committed design choice.
- **The Compare tab** — its head-to-head scorecard and generation-speed bar
  race are now a section of the Models tab.
- **The heatmap's table-view toggle** — not part of the redesign; the heatmap
  keeps its per-cell hover tooltips.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-03

First public release: the repository is now public, and this tag publishes the
first signed multi-arch container image to GHCR with SBOM and build provenance.

### Fixed

- **Unauthenticated panic in the login handler.** A percent-escape followed by a
  multibyte UTF-8 character (e.g. `password=%€`) in the `POST /login` body sliced a
  `&str` on a non-char boundary and panicked. Percent-decoding is now byte-safe.
- **No timeout on non-streaming upstream reads.** A buffered request whose upstream
  sent headers then stalled the body could hang forever, pinning an in-flight slot.
  Non-streaming requests now honor `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 300s) and surface a
  `502` on a stalled/failed body read. Streaming still uses `STREAM_IDLE_SECS`.
- **`RPM_PER_KEY=0` wedged the dispatcher** (out-of-bounds index in the pacer). Now
  rejected at startup.
- Login throttle window uses saturating subtraction (robust to clock adjustments).

### Added

- `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` config (default 300).

### Changed

- Regression tests for all of the above; coverage raised to ~90%.

### Performance

- Build with `opt-level = 3` (was `"z"`): the release profile optimized for size,
  throttling the JSON-parse and SSE-scan hot paths. Binary grows ~3.5→4.6 MB.
- Drop a deep clone of the whole request body on the streaming injection path
  (move it instead); use `Bytes::from_static` for the SSE control frames.
- Routine `cargo update` (`rustc-hash` patch).

### Dependencies

- Bump `metrics-exporter-prometheus` 0.17 → 0.18 and refresh CI/release action
  versions, including the Node 24 runtime wave (gitleaks-action v3, the docker/*
  build actions, download-artifact v8).
- Hold the auth crypto/RNG stack (`hmac` 0.12, `sha2` 0.10, `getrandom` 0.2) on
  the proven-stable line — the proposed 0.13/0.11/0.3 majors are breaking with no
  security fix; Dependabot is configured to only take patches for these.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-02

The proxy becomes a **benchmarking and agent-observability tool**: because it
sits in the request path for every harness and model, it can now report *how*
each agent behaves and *how well* each model responds — all from counts and
sizes, never message content.

### Added

- **Request-shape & response-quality metrics**, captured from the request path
  that was already deserialized and scanned: conversation depth, tools offered,
  sampling temperature, `max_tokens`, stream-vs-buffered and JSON-mode mix
  (labeled by client/harness), plus finish-reason/truncation, tool calls,
  reasoning ("thinking") tokens, and mean TPOT (labeled by model). Everything is
  bounded-cardinality with server-clamped enums — counts and sizes only, never
  content. See `knowledge/decisions/request-shape-metrics.md`.
- **Six persona-aligned dashboard views** (Overview, Models, Compare, Harnesses,
  Proxy, Keys), rebuilt from the previous three tabs, each ordered
  at-a-glance → trends → detail, in light and dark mode. Adds a head-to-head
  model scorecard, per-harness fingerprints, and a hash-to-hue color fallback
  past the six categorical slots.
- Generation-speed (tok/s) median/p95 trend, a ranked non-success-outcome
  breakdown, and threshold-colored capacity/success-rate gauges.
- Example [`examples/opencode.json`](examples/opencode.json) config tuned for
  GLM-5.2 (context, compaction, sampling), with rationale in
  `examples/README.md`.

### Changed

- Test coverage extended to the buffered `relay()` quality path, an
  unknown-`finish_reason` → `other` clamp, JSON mode, and non-`auto`
  `tool_choice` — now **29 unit + 21 e2e** tests.
- Load harness gained tool/JSON/sampling variety and a corrected boot command
  (`INSECURE_NO_AUTH`); re-run clean at 240 requests, 0 failures, 0 upstream
  rate violations, balanced across all keys.

### Security

- Pre-merge hardening pass: a dedicated dashboard-XSS audit plus a full security
  review of the branch found **zero** vulnerabilities — every new `innerHTML`
  value is escaped, every new label is a bounded enum/histogram, and no route
  left the admin gate.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-02

Security-hardening release. A review of the merged proxy found a stored-XSS
chain, unbounded metric-label cardinality, log injection, and an open-by-default
posture. All fixed.

### Added

- **Fail-closed auth.** The proxy refuses to start on a network-reachable port
  without auth. Secure mode requires `PROXY_API_KEYS` (gates `/v1/*`, any key
  works, constant-time compare) and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (gates the dashboard,
  `/metrics`, and `/api/history` via an HMAC-signed, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict
  session cookie; Bearer/Basic for scrapers). Open mode is an explicit
  `INSECURE_NO_AUTH=true` opt-in. See
  `knowledge/decisions/auth-posture-and-dashboard-password.md`.
- Failed-login throttle, a rejected-API-key delay, and a `MAX_INFLIGHT`
  flood-shedding cap.
- `cargo audit` in CI.

### Security

- **Input sanitizing.** Client-controlled `model`/`path` labels are sanitized to
  a conservative charset, length-capped, and cardinality-bounded at ingest —
  killing the exposition/log-injection and cardinality-blowup vectors. The
  dashboard `esc()`-escapes every dynamic `innerHTML` sink, and all responses
  carry a strict `Content-Security-Policy` plus anti-framing/anti-sniffing
  headers. See `knowledge/decisions/input-sanitizing-and-xss.md`.
- Compose now publishes `127.0.0.1:8000:8000` (loopback) by default, so a bare
  `docker compose up` can't accidentally expose an open instance.
- Verified with a real-browser XSS check (payload rendered inert), a secure-mode
  load test (300/300, 0 rate violations), and a clean `cargo audit`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-02

Observability and hardening enrichments on top of the core proxy.

### Added

- **Prometheus `/metrics`** exposition and optional client access keys
  (`PROXY_API_KEYS`) for per-client attribution.
- **Built-in dashboard** — a single embedded HTML file (no Grafana, no config) —
  plus an ASCII boot banner, structured startup detail, one-line-per-request
  access logs (TTY-detected ANSI color), and a self-probe healthcheck
  (`nim-proxy --health`) that works `FROM scratch`.
- **Metrics history**: a ~4 KB snapshot every 5 minutes, retained `HISTORY_DAYS`
  days, powering time-range reports (1h/6h/24h/7d/30d + custom) that survive
  restart.
- Model cards with id-namespace enrichment (the `/v1/models` schema research
  killed the idea of API-sourced descriptions).

### Changed

- Proxy hardened and given a full test suite (unit + e2e against a scripted mock
  NIM) and a load harness (`scripts/mock_nim.py --enforce` + `scripts/loadtest.py`).
- The `knowledge/` Open Knowledge Format bundle was compiled: design decisions,
  validated NIM research, architecture notes, and runbooks.

### Fixed

- Docker build on the musl-host Alpine builder: pass an explicit `--target` so
  global `crt-static` RUSTFLAGS skip proc-macro dylibs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-01

Initial rate-limit-aware proxy.

### Added

- OpenAI-compatible pass-through to NVIDIA NIM with **per-key sliding-window
  rate limiting** (40 requests per rolling 60 s, matching NIM's limiter) and
  multi-key load balancing.
- **Global FIFO dispatcher** — one queue for all clients, slots granted strictly
  in arrival order, abandoned-waiter slots returned — for fair multi-client
  allocation.
- **Conversation affinity with least-loaded spillover**: each conversation pins
  to one key to keep the server-side prefix cache warm, spilling to the
  least-loaded ready lane when its lane is full.
- **Distroless image**: a static musl binary shipped `FROM scratch` (~3.5 MB,
  TLS roots compiled in), running non-root with hardened compose defaults.
