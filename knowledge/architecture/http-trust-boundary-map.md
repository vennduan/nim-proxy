# HTTP trust-boundary map

`src/lib.rs` is the only handler registry. It registers handlers through the
fixed path constants in `src/routes.rs`; the `RouteContract` rows in that
module are test-only descriptive metadata and cannot dispatch a request.
`RouteContract.path` is the registered/OpenAPI template, while
`probe_path` is a concrete fixture-backed request path. This distinction is
load-bearing for `/v1/{*path}` and future parameterized routes.

The current router has 36 method/path contracts, including nine presentation
asset routes. A
superuser has no exclusive route: it has admin endpoint power plus the
undeletable/undemotable account invariant. `OperatorSuperuser` exists so a
future exclusive boundary must be declared deliberately, not inferred from
the role name.

## Contract matrix

The compact proof labels are:

- **M** — `routes::tests::inventory_agrees_with_generated_openapi` owns the
  compiled inventory, method/path membership, OpenAPI security inheritance,
  phase counts, fixture probe paths, the explicit asset inventory, and the
  no-superuser-exclusive-route decision.
- **B** — `route_contract_behavior_matrix` sends real requests through the
  binary in before-setup, anonymous configured, ordinary-user, admin, and
  superuser states. Each row asserts status/error, request and success content
  types, exact `config.json` before/after bytes, session-cookie presence, and
  exact coarse upstream-call deltas. Endpoint-specific tests and component
  pages, not B, own internal publication, cache, pool, and session semantics.
- **C** — `route_contract_client_auth_matrix` proves pre-setup closure and
  keyed-mode missing/wrong/valid bearer behavior independently of operator
  sessions, including upstream and durable-byte effects.
- **O** — `route_contract_ownership_matrix` adds own/other rows for NIM and
  client keys and proves rejected foreign writes preserve durable bytes.

Every JSON `/api` and setup POST additionally inherits the extractor codes
`body_too_large`, `invalid_json`, and `unsupported_media_type`; the `/api`
subtree owns `invalid_query`, `method_not_allowed`, and `not_found` where
applicable. Their exact envelopes and ordering live in
[typed responses and generated OpenAPI](../decisions/typed-responses-and-generated-openapi.md),
not a second copy here.

## Boundary ownership

Phase and operator authentication are owned by `require_session`; client
authentication and pre-setup data-plane closure are owned by the proxy handler.
Setup POST handlers perform their phase check before extraction. Handler role
and resource-ownership checks run only after the session boundary. The exact
identity and role rules remain in [client auth](client-auth.md).

All config writers follow build candidate → validate → persist → publish live
state. The E2E table therefore treats a rejected write as wrong if even one
durable byte changes. Upstream-only probes must change no config bytes. The
data-plane scheduling, response, and observation details remain in the
[streaming pipeline](streaming-pipeline.md).

Authentication is the telemetry boundary, not a tenancy filter: every
authenticated role receives the same established pool payload from `/metrics`,
`/api/dashboard`, and `/api/dashboard/now`, including bounded metric labels.
`GET /api/config` is the deliberate exception: it filters foreign owned keys
and admin-only sections before serialization. The focused multi-user E2E proof
is `shared_observability_is_identical_across_roles_while_config_stays_scoped`.

Generated OpenAPI describes 15 `/api` operations, two setup POST
operations, and the Messages-bridge `createAnthropicMessage` operation (the
SSE translator adds `anthropicSSEStream` at M2). The locale bootstrap is
public with explicit `security: []`; the other 14 `/api` operations inherit
operator authentication; the bridge names its `client_key` scheme explicitly
instead of inheriting. HTML/form,
presentation assets, health, metrics, and `/v1`
omissions are explicit
decisions. The generated-file authority and error schema remain in
[typed responses and generated OpenAPI](../decisions/typed-responses-and-generated-openapi.md).
